## Your Code, Your Rules

SvelDocs provides you with all of the code for creating modern markdown documentation websites. In fact, this very site is the boilerplate code.

The files are structured for quick iterations and detailed understanding, while still offering easy expansion. SvelDocs offers a settings file with preset options that should fit most needs, but in the chance that something doesnt match your taste, you can always customize the code to your liking.

## Features

- Simple structure for adding groups and links
- Settings to change the documentation look and structure
- Table of Contents
- Searching
- Remark / Rehype plugins
- API to expose markdown text
- Themed code blocks

## Inspiration

I found it difficult to find a nice looking and customizable template with all of the features that I wanted for creating documentation, so I decided to make it myself.

Commonly used documentation websites that I used for research include:

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)
- [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs)
- [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/docs)
- [Bits UI](https://bits-ui.com/docs)
