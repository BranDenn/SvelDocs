## Your Code, Your Rules

SvelDocs provides you with all of the code for creating modern markdown documentation websites. In fact, this very site is the boilerplate code.

The files are structured for quick iterations and detailed understanding, while still offering easy expansion. SvelDocs provides a settings file with preset options that should fit most needs, but in the chance that something does not match your taste, you can always customize the code to your liking.

## Inspiration

I found it difficult to find a nice looking and customizable template with all of the features that I wanted for creating documentation, so I decided to make it myself.

Commonly used documentation websites that I used for research include:

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)
- [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs)
- [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/docs)
- [Bits UI](https://bits-ui.com/docs)
